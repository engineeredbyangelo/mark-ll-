# Image Assets

Place module thumbnails, mascot sprites, and other image assets here.

## Directory Structure

```
images/
├── mascot/          # Spark mascot animations and states
├── thumbnails/      # Module preview images
├── backgrounds/     # Gradient backgrounds and textures
└── icons/          # Custom icon assets
```

## Guidelines

- Use WebP format for better compression
- Provide @2x and @3x versions for high-DPI screens
- Keep file sizes optimized (<500KB per image)
- Follow naming convention: `asset_name_@2x.webp`
